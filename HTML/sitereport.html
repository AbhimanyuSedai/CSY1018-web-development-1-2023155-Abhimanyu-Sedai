                        In this site report, i will be talking about my journey of creating this website. The purpose of this website is to illustrate my potential and skills.<br> 
                        At the beginning of this project, I was quite frighten of the work i had to do. At first, I made a plan where i seperated work according to its<br>
                        importance. I also decided what elements to add or remove from my web pages and did my research accordingly.

                    <p class="hero-para">
                        Designing this website was one of the most challenging thing to overcome in this assignment. Initally i was planning to go for a yellowish white<br>
                        background but after going through some websites, i found black background appealing. Added to that, i also found white font color with some<br>
                        orange touch was perfect color scheme to go with. Talking about the font, I used <a class="click-a" href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Font</a>
                        to import the fonts. I used 'Michroma' , 'Rajdhani' and<br>'Work Sans' for my website as it was looking teckey. I used HTML and CSS to make my website responsive
                        which means it can adjust to different<br> size resolutions. I also imported various <a class="click-a" href="https://www.flaticon.com/" target="_blank">custom icons</a> according
                        to my choice to make my website look more attractive and clean. I also added other<br> design elements ie hover, animations, transitions etc.

                    <p class="hero-para">
                        The website contains of several pages containing home-page, portfolio, contact, experience and site-report page. In the <a class="click-b" href="../HTML/index.html" target="_blank">Home Page</a>
                        i included a<br> brief intro about me and my website. I also added some animations and interactive pictures to encourage the visitors. The 
                        <a class="click-b" href="../HTML/portfolio.html" target="_blank">Portfolio Page</a> contains<br> some random pictures as assigned. The <a class="click-b" href="../HTML/contact.html" target="_blank">Contact Page</a>
                        is where the visitors can get in touch with me. There is a form you can fill and leave a messege<br> or directly contact me through my details mentioned in the page. You can learn my work 
                        history from <a class="click-b" href="../HTML/experience.html" target="_blank">Experience Page</a>. I have also added some<br> animations to make it more interesting. Lastly, the 
                        <a class="click-b" href="../HTML/sitereport.html">SiteReport Page</a> provides a comprehensive overview of the website's structure, functionality,<br> contents and design.

                    <p class="hero-para">
                        One of the main challenge of creating this website was to make it responsive to every screen resolutions. I was stuck in a problem and even web<br>
                        searches couldnt help. I eventually overcame it by going through every line of my code. The other challenge was to make my website functionally<br>
                        and visually appealing. I was also in a dilemma to choose a design for my navigation bar. I had to do my nav bar for several times to get my<br>
                        final design.

                        Overall, this assignment was very rewarding inspite of its challenges. Not only i have broaden my knowledge about web development but also<br>
